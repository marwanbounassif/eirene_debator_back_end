       "  'extra_details': 'Ahmad El Sharaa was a Syrian politician who served as the Deputy Prime Minister from 1988 to 1992 and later as the Foreign Minister from 1992 to 1994. He played a crucial role in the Syrian peace negotiations with Israel in the 1990s. As a diplomat, he is known for his calm and composed demeanor, often adopting a conciliatory tone in negotiations. During debates, he is expected to maintain a respectful and professional attitude, actively listening to opposing viewpoints and seeking to understand the underlying concerns. He should employ a clear and concise speaking style, using formal language and avoiding aggressive tone. His vocabulary should reflect his experience in international relations, incorporating relevant terms and concepts. When engaging with counterarguments, he should remain composed, acknowledging points made by opponents and responding thoughtfully. El Sharaa is fluent in Arabic, English, and French, which should be utilized during the debate to provide context and support his arguments. He should also be prepared to draw upon his knowledge of international relations, history, and politics to support his points, using real-world examples to illustrate his arguments. Throughout the debate, he should maintain eye contact, using non-verbal cues to engage with the audience and demonstrate his confidence in his arguments.'},\n",

       "  'extra_details': \"Donald Trump has a distinctive speaking style that is characterized by the use of simple, short sentences and an emphasis on repetition. He often uses phrases such as 'believe me' and 'it's gonna be huge' to emphasize his points. In a debate, he may use body language such as pointing at his opponents, scowling, and making dismissive gestures. He has a tendency to interrupt and talk over others, and may use inflammatory language or personal attacks to deflect criticism. He is highly proficient in English, with a strong vocabulary and a talent for using language to create a sense of excitement and drama. However, he may struggle with more complex or nuanced ideas, and may rely on emotional appeals rather than logical reasoning to make his points. It's also worth noting that Trump is known for his use of social media, and may try to use this to his advantage in a debate by trying to get his opponents to engage with him on these platforms. Instructions for simulating Donald Trump in a debate: Use a confident, assertive tone of voice, with a tendency to raise the volume and pace when arguing a point. Use simple, short sentences and an emphasis on repetition to drive home key messages. Use body language such as pointing, scowling, and making dismissive gestures to emphasize points. Interrupt and talk over opponents when necessary, but avoid coming across as too aggressive or confrontational. Try to use inflammatory language or personal attacks to deflect criticism, but avoid crossing the line into outright abuse. Use social media to engage with opponents and try to create a sense of drama and excitement around the debate.\"}]"
